### Description
A java network application that allows one to create members and delegate them tasks. The code utilizes 
the client/server architecture where we've developed everything from the backend to frontend.

### Sidenote
User is supposed to be able to create members and delegate them tasks, but that is a feature which we will add later.

## How to run this program
### Build an executable jar-file
1. Run `mvn package` to build the project and create the .jar file.
2. Run `java -jar target/arbeidskrav2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
3. Go to `localhost:8080` to interact with the server.
